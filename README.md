# hello-world

I'm Daryl.

I am a career shifter. From graduating as a BS psychology major, I decided to pursue my passion for coding and enrolled in Zuitt Coding Bootcamp which helped me propelled my career to becoming a full stack web developer.

While I love coding, I also like reading books, manga and watching anime.
